    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (derived class) is created from an existing class (base class) by inheriting its properties and behaviors. This facilitates code reuse, allowing derived classes to inherit and extend the functionality of base classes, promoting modularity and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling them to be used interchangeably. It allows methods to be invoked on objects without knowing their specific types, promoting flexibility and simplifying code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves the representation of essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It allows for the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define a blueprint for classes to implement, facilitating code organization, reuse, and modularity."

    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the concept of \"self\" is used to refer to the current instance of a class within its own methods or properties. It allows methods to access and manipulate the attributes and behaviors of the specific instance to which they belong. \"Self\" acts as a reference to the instance itself, enabling the class to differentiate between different instances and interact with their respective data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In languages such as Python, \"self\" is explicitly passed as the first parameter to instance methods. This parameter serves as a placeholder for the instance that invokes the method. By convention, it is named \"self\" for clarity and consistency, although other names can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of \"self\" facilitates encapsulation and abstraction, which are fundamental principles of OOP. Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces, typically methods. \"Self\" helps in maintaining this encapsulation by providing a means for methods to access the object's state while preventing direct manipulation of its attributes from external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, \"self\" enables polymorphism, inheritance, and method overriding, which are key features of OOP. It allows subclasses to override methods defined in their parent classes and still have access to the instance-specific data via \"self\", ensuring that the correct implementation is invoked based on the actual type of the object at runtime.\n",
